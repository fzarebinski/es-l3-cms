Expert System for L3 CMS
=====================
Small C# application created to get a credit on my university. Project has implemented Expert System (with sample model for L3 CMS).

## How it works?
This is simple console apllication, so just compile and answer on some questions to get a solution.

Technically the project contains two main classes `Decision` and `Solution`. Using this two classes you can create a decision tree and declare solutions for every situation. `ExpertUtil` is a class used only to load sample data and generate view.

## Is it properly implementation?
Yes, but there can be some edge cases where apllication can be crashed.

## Can I use it?
Sure, the code is shared on MIT License. However, **I would be grateful for a star** in the project.

## What has been used to created it?
Software created with love to coding in Cracow.
* IDE: Visual Studio 2017,
* OS: Windows 10.

## Can we talk about the implementation?
Sure. I am open to teach you and make the code clearer, so you can reach the goal.
