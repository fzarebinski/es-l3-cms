# IMPORTANT NOTICE
This is small project prepared to pass another semester on my University. Some mistakes can be included and some things can be done better. This code is only to give you inspiration and show you my own idea, not to use in commercial solutions.

# Expert System (with example model for L3 CMS)
I want to introduce quick expert system based on C#. All what you need is map your solution on tree and then map this in program array.

## How it's working?
It's base solution based on tree model. You have one desicision and depend on your answer you can skip to the another decision. If there is no decision, you can use `-1` and then program is looking for solution.

## How can I build solution in system?
It's simple. Everything what you need is to write solution and map of desisions `{ iterator, answer }` where `iterator` is number of decision (iterator in array) and answer is `true` or `false`.

## Can I check example of decision tree?
Sure, ckech `es.pdf` file :)

## Why I did it?
I did it as Project for University.

### Why L3 CMS?
I love this software :)

### Why all content is polish?
Because university is in Poland :)

## Can I use this solution?
You can only get inspiration. I know that some things can be done better, but I pushed this to show you example of a way. Not to give you good solution to copy&paste.
