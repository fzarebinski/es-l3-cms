# IMPORTANT NOTICE
This is small project prepared to pass another semester on my University. Some mistakes can be included and some things can be done better. This code is only to give you inspiration and show you my own idea, not to use in commercial solutions.

# Expert System (with example model for L3 CMS)
I want to introduce quick expert system based on C#. All what you need is map your solution on tree and then map this in program array.

## How it's working?
It's base solution based on tree model. You have one desicision and depend on your answer you can skip to the another decision. If there is no decision, you can use `-1` and then program is looking for solution.

## How can I build solution in system?
It's simple. Everything what you need is to write solution and map of desisions `{ iterator, answer }` where `iterator` is number of decision (iterator in array) and answer is `true` or `false`.

## Can I check example of decision tree?
Sure, ckech `es.pdf` file :)

## Why I did it?
I did it as Project for University.

### Why L3 CMS?
I love this software :)

### Why all content is polish?
Because university is in Poland :)

## Can I use this solution?
You can only get inspiration. I know that some things can be done better, but I pushed this to show you example of a way. Not to give you good solution to copy&paste.

Expert System for L3 CMS
=====================
Small C# application created to get a credit on my university. Project has implemented Expert System (with sample model for L3 CMS).

## How it works?
This is simple console apllication, so just compile and answer on some questions to get a solution.

Technically the project contains two main classes `Decision` and `Solution`. Using this two classes you can create a decision tree and declare solutions for every situation. `ExpertUtil` is a class used only to load sample data and generate view.

## Is it properly implementation?
Yes, but there can be some edge cases where apllication can be crashed.

## Can I use it?
Sure, the code is shared on MIT License. However, **I would be grateful for a star** in the project.

## What has been used to created it?
Software created with love to coding in Cracow.
* IDE: Visual Studio 2017,
* OS: Windows 10.

## Can we talk about the implementation?
Sure. I am open to teach you and make the code clearer, so you can reach the goal.
